UpdatedPortfolio    Created with HTML , CSS, SASS, Font Awesome, and Jquery mixed with Javascript.

The design is a one page layout with a parallax scrolling element added for user interaction.

A daring approach at putting the majority of the content on the bottom of the page, hoping that the user is intrigued enough to continue scrolling.

Lets Taco Bout it (Group Project)      https://jirafaro.github.io/lets-taco-bout-it/

<Description>
Lets Taco Bout it is an application that was created by, and for, the Taco Enthusiast. The application allows the user to choose between taco recipes and taco servers, and to save their favorites
<Motivation>
Our project solves the timeless problem of decision making. Assuming people aren’t accidentally navigating to Lets Taco Bout it, we can start with the premise that the user is aware of their desire for Tacos. We then solve the problem, depending on the value of the users motivation, whether or not they should cook or order tacos; we do this by providing them with a multitude of choices in both recipes and restaurants, one of which is sure to catch the average taco enthusiasts eye! 
<Results>
Using TacoFancyAPI and YelpAPI we were able to create an app that gives users a choice between making or purchasing tacos. Ultimately, the end result is a well polished application that functions intuitively with an easy to follow user interface. 
<Team Efforts>
Our team naturally split into ‘front end’ and ‘back end’; with two of us on each side. From here we took advantage of the task listing application within Github to create a set of tasks for each front end and back end. 
<Individual Responsibilities>
Austin → I worked on the front end with Nich, specifically on the Recipes page. I created stylized classes with SASS that could be used to store the data dynamically populated by the Tacofancy.js using the TacofancyAPI. This was accomplished by working hand in hand with John who was in charge of the backend portion. I additionally assisted in bug finding and fixing. For me, the biggest challenge was learning how to use SASS with the CSS and trying to keep up with Nich who was already familiar with SASS. 
GROUP Challenges → A challenge everyone in the group quarrelled with at least once was with Git merging and Git branches cooperating with the master. Towards the end of the project we all felt reasonably comfortable with problem solving through the merging process.
<Improvements>
We had talked about potentially adding a Hash to the website that would allow users to take the Application to their social circles and spread the word. Following this we would most certainly add a link to Twitter as well so the user can navigate from the App to Twitter. We were also pondering implementation of a Back button feature that would allow the user to navigate back to the previous page that they were on.
